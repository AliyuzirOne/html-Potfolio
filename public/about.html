<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I graduated with First Class Honors from Ahmadu Bello University, ranking in the
  top 5% of my class. My academic journey has provided me with a solid
  foundation in engineering principles, particularly in resource management and
  environmental sustainability. This has sparked my passion for drilling
  engineering, where efficient resource extraction must be balanced with
  environmental protection.

  During my Internship at OneGeospatial Nigeria Limited, I gained hands-on
  experience in drilling boreholes and supervising drilling operations. This
  role allowed me to enhance my technical skills while ensuring compliance with
  safety and environmental standards. Additionally, I was involved in analyzing
  data for potential drilling sites in Akwa Ibom, which deepened my
  understanding of site selection and the importance of thorough assessments in
  drilling projects.

  Currently, I am a lecturer at Kogi State Polytechnic, where I teach courses
  related to Water Resources and Environmental Engineering. This position has
  enabled me to inspire future engineers about sustainable practices in the
  drilling industry. I emphasize innovative solutions that mitigate
  environmental impact and prepare my students to tackle challenges in their
  careers.
